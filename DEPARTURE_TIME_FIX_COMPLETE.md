# Departure Time Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🕕 **Critical Transportation Departure Times Added**

### **✅ Problem Solved:**
The Critical Transportation section was showing only flight numbers without departure times:
- **Before**: `NH7333, NH7011`
- **After**: `NH7333, NH7011 | Depart: 06:00`

### **🔧 Technical Fix Applied:**

**Enhanced `formatCriticalTransportation()` Function:**
- Now accepts both `transportation` text AND `activities` array
- **Smart departure time extraction** from activities when not in transportation field
- Searches for activities containing "Depart" or "🛫" keywords
- **Fallback logic** to transportation field if activities don't contain timing

**Updated Function Call:**
```javascript
// Before
this.formatCriticalTransportation(day.transportation)

// After  
this.formatCriticalTransportation(day.transportation, day.activities)
```

### **🛫 Flight Detection Logic:**

**Departure Time Sources (in priority order):**
1. **Activities**: Searches for departure activities with 🛫 emoji or "Depart" text
2. **Transportation field**: Extracts times from transportation text as fallback
3. **Smart filtering**: Ignores "In-flight" and other non-departure times

**Flight Number Extraction:**
- Regex pattern: `/NH\d+/g` to find all ANA flight numbers
- Joins multiple flights with commas: `NH7333, NH7011`

### **✨ Enhanced Results:**

**Day 0 (Departure from USA):**
```
Critical Transportation
NH7333, NH7011 | Depart: 06:00
```

**Day 17 (Return to USA):**  
```
Critical Transportation
NH7010, NH7332 | Depart: 13:30
```

### **🌸 Benefits:**
- ✅ **Quick reference** for departure times at a glance
- ✅ **No need to scroll** through activities to find flight times
- ✅ **Consistent formatting** across all critical transportation
- ✅ **Smart extraction** works even when times are in different data fields
